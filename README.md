# Baka Chat
A small Foundry module to make natural 1s and 20s more fun.

Ever wanted to be praised on that Nat 20 or feel ashamed when you rolled a Nat 1? Well, then this is a module for you, for you will be judged on every Nat 20 or Nat 1 you roll - enjoy!

You can use your own images instead of the provided ones - just choose one in the settings.

## Supported Modules:
* [Better Rolls 5E](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/betterrolls5e)
